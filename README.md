## Description

Ace of Cups is a tiny app that lends itself to the moments of clarity and guidance found in the tarot. Utilizing Rachel Howe’s Small Spells tarot deck and writings, we can glimpse the energy of any situation with peace and reception through a simple traditional three-card-pull. We can look at these cards as “past” “present” and ”future” in order to note how we may shift our energies to more gracefully move through the situation in question.
